# HAETAE_index-based_challenge_polymult

HAETAE is one out of two digital signature finalists algorithms of KpqC competition.
We implemented index-based sparse binary challenge polynomial multiplication on HAETAE's reference implementation.
index-based challenge polynomial multiplication replaces ntt-based one.
